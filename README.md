## Features:

* Uses a Custom World Hopper Handler (**TLDR:** You can choose your desired world regions or you can use your own CUSTOM list).
  * Region Selection: EU, NAEast, NaWest, AUS.
  * Enable/Disable Total World Hopping.
  * Configurable CUSTOM World List.
* 
* It will automatically detect most stuff that you might do wrong and stop the script telling you what was the cause.
* 

## Requirements:
```
- Have your equipment and weapon pre-equiped.
- 
- Set EXP Bar to PRAYER ONLY. NOT TOTAL SKILLS. (If you want accurate EXP/Hr reports)
- Make sure to already have your armour + weapon equiped before starting.
- Check the Script requirements before making a post about issues.
- Check the official OSRS Wiki for more info:

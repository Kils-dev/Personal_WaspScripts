# Personal WaspScripts
 This is my rep. for simba scripts.

# Current Public Scripts:
<details>
<summary>Reanimate_Kilsbigpils.simba</summary>
 
## Features:
```
*- Uses a Custom World Hopper Handler (**TLDR:** does not rely on your saved worlds, but you can configure your prefered worlds if you want).
*- It will automatically detect most stuff that you might do wrong and stop the script telling you the cause.
*- 
```
## Requirements:
```
*- Have your equipment and weapon pre-equiped.
*- 
*- Set EXP Bar to PRAYER ONLY. NOT TOTAL SKILLS. (If you want accurate EXP/Hr reports)
*- Make sure to already have your armour + weapon equiped before starting.
*- Check the Script requirements before making a post about issues.
*- Check the official OSRS Wiki for more info:

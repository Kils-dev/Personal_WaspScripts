## Features:
```
- Uses a Custom World Hopper Handler (**TLDR:** You can choose your desired world regions or you can use your own CUSTOM list):
  -- You can Enable/Disable World Hopping.
  -- You can Enable/Disable Total Level World Hopping.
  -- Regions: EU, NAEast, NAWest, AUS.
  -- Configurable CUSTOM World List.

- Automatically:
  -- Detects if the user has a anti-fire shield equiped to fight Ensouled Dragon Heads.
  -- Detects if the user is wearing a Serpentine helm to fight Ensouled Kalphite Heads.
     --- In case the user is not wearing it it will withdraw the Antipoison you specified in the settings.
  -- Uses the correct Prayer Protection if it's enabled in the settings.
     --- Make sure you have the required Prayer level to use Protect from Melee and/or Protect from Missile (if you don't it will also detect this).
  -- Detect most stuff that you might do wrong and stop the script, telling you what was the cause.
  -- Teleports to the bank you specified in the settings if your health is bellow 30%.

- [3] Supported Bank locations:
  -- Castle Wars, Ferox Enclave, Grand Exchange.

- [2] Supported Travel methods:
  -- Arceus Library and Fairy Ring (Requires Ardougne Cape 1..4);
    --- Automatically detects if you have Elite Lumbridge Diaries before using the Fairy Ring travel method.
      ---- You also require to have pre-purchased the fairy ring unlock. (Check the osrs wiki if you are unsure).

- You can Enable/Disable use of Food and/or Prayer pots.
  -- You can also specify what food to use and the amount.

- Experimental Summoning spot (Works best with 1 tile sized Monsters).

- For biger monsters it will use a different method of tile clicking to Summon the Ensouled Heads to avoid issues. (ONLY if ExperimentalSummonSpot is disable).

- You can make extra changes if you know what you are doing inside of the "Init" procedure. 
```
## Requirements:
```
- Have your equipment and weapon pre-equiped.
- Have your desired Head in your bank.
- Have the Fairy ring near the altar unlock if using it (Search for it on reddit/youtube if needed).
- Have a Ring of Dueling if using the Castle Wars/Ferox Enclave bank, alternatively, a Ring of Wealth if using the Grand Exchange.
- 
- Set EXP Bar to PRAYER ONLY. NOT TOTAL SKILLS (If you want accurate Exp/Hr reports).
- Make sure to already have your armour + weapon equiped before starting.
- Check the Script requirements before making a post about issues.
